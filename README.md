Create a new GitHub repository called Week11-Hangman, then clone it to your computer.

Inside your local Week11-Hangman folder, make files called game.js, letter.js, main.js and word.js.
With the files from Step 2, you'll put together a console-based hangman app that incorporates objects, user-input and constructors in its solution.

Both letter.js and word.js should be constructor files:
word.js should contain all of the methods which will check the letters guessed versus the random word selected.


letter.js should control whether or not a letter appears as a "_" or as itself on-screen.
========================================================================================
Your game.js file will randomly select a word for the player.
main.js will contain the logic of your app. Running it in Terminal/Bash will start the game.
The app should end when a player guesses the correct word or runs out of guesses.
Tips

Program the game one piece at a time! Break the program down into fragments rather than chipping away little by little at giant, abstract problem.
Focus on one part of the smaller problem and get some code working.
Rinse and repeat (and remember, console.log is your friend).
